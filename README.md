  **Python Programs: Lists, Strings, and Loops**

This README file provides a guide to several Python programs that demonstrate how to work with lists, strings, and loops. These programs cover common tasks such as counting elements, finding maximum and minimum values, removing elements, finding averages, checking if lists are empty, finding indices, checking for palindromes, finding common elements, removing duplicates, and sorting lists.
